The first step in project planning is establishing a Team Agreement. This will be used as the guideline for how your team will collaborate during project week

Projects are stressful, and can ignite emotions that otherwise wouldn’t be a problem. It’s important that the safety and security of the group comes first, and that an agreement is in place to establish expectations and accountability among the whole group. Planning
